          <h1 class="post_title">Hello, World!</h1>
          <p><p>In this first article titled “Hello, World” (a bit Cliché), I want to write about why the blog started and the plans
that I have for the future of this blog.</p>
<p><img src="https://unsplash.com/photos/AiKGBw_EJkU/download" alt="Long Journey" title="A long journey."></p>
<p>I follow a lot of personal blogs like <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/">Coding Horror</a>, <a href="https://martinfowler.com/">Martin
Fowler</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Graham Essays</a> and many more that I
come across through <a href="https://news.hackernews.com/">Hacker News</a>. I am always amazed at how impactful these “One Person”
blogs are and the amount of discussion each piece of article brings.</p>
<p>Be it an article on emerging technology, software engineering methodologies or entrepreneurship, these blogs always put
forth new ideas as well as lessons that were learnt by the writers in hard ways. They can be a valuable resource to a
reader who wants to go on a similar journey.</p>
<p>But the reasons I’ve started to write a blog are not to imitate those “Titans” that I mentioned earlier. I needed a
place where I could write whatever I wanted to.  It doesn’t matter if I’m the only reader. But I secretly hope it
doesn’t happen though.</p>
<p>I have a rough idea about the kind of topics that I want to write on.  I want to write about the things that matter to
me the most - the programs on which I spent many nightless hours just to learn them, the Free and Open Source Software
that always made technology accessible to me and the projects that I’m currently working on. I also want to share my
personal views on events and technologies that I come across.</p>
<p>I want to mention that my love for OSS is immense. I’m writing this piece of article on an open source terminal
<a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm</a>, using an open source editor <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and an open source static site
generator <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. These programs are the outcomes of selfless sacrifices of hackers all around the
world. This kind of collaboration is rare in other fields of study which makes me even more proud that I’m a part of
this community.</p>
<p>Finally, with that said, I welcome everyone (or just me) on this journey where we will sit on the front seat to look at
how the future unfolds.</p>
